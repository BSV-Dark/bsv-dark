Bitcoin SV
===========

What is Bitcoin SV?
-------------------

BSV-Dark (Satoshi Vision) is the original Bitcoin. Rescuing the *original* vision of Satoshi Nakamoto (Craig Wright)
as electronic cash(!) from the Blockstream-funded imposter Calvin Ayre's vision of a database. Bitcoin is not Ethereum!
BSV-Dark will protect the vision set out by Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s white paper in 2008.
